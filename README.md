## Hello there, I'm Antoine!

Currently working at the french eHealth Agency: https://ue.esante.gouv.fr/acknowledged-institutional-accelerator-ehealth-france-and-europe/ehealth-agency-ans
And to be very precise, putting in place the MyHealth@EU programme to share patients' data across Europe: https://ue.esante.gouv.fr/defining-european-ehealth-framework-and-contributing-common-approach/myhealtheu-program-france

I like **technology and collaborative projects in eHealth**, I worked within two Horizon 2020 projects, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The overall objective is to create an innovative framework on ICT tools and services that can be deployed in cities to improve the health of the population in the urban context. 


**Embedded Systems Engineer**, I received a master's degree from ECE Paris and had the opportunity to share my time between Europe and Asia. I specialized in Internet-of-Things, playing around with electronics components and controllers.
